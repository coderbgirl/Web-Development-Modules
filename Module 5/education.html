            <h2>Primary school - Little Flowers</h2>
            <p>
                I compeleted my primary education in Little flowers school. My days at this school were very good. I
                was able to make many friends here and the 8 years I spent here shaped my personality. I enjoyed every
                moment here.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well almost every moment, to be precise.<br> The reason for that was my History class. I hated History.
                I pretty much nailed Basic Sciences and Math but History was my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel">Achilles'
                    heel</a>.

                    I was very active student that time. I participated in almost every extra
                    curricular activity and I played many sports
                    like <i>kho-kho, hand ball, kabbadi </i>
                    etc. Eventally, I became the captain of a few athletics teams, while keeping a strong focus on my
                    studies. Of all the great memories, my favourite was the one when I got the 1<sup>st</sup>
                    prize in 400 meter race at state level. My parents, teachers and classmates were very proud. I got
                    many prizes from my school and other government organizations. I guess that was
                    best time of my life.

            <h2>Higher education - Panchsheel Vidhyalaya</h2>
            <p>
                After primary school, I finished my high school education in Panchsheel Vidhyalaya.
            </p>
            <p>Compared to my primary school life, my higher studies were very differnt. I took science as my major. In
                my high school, I was primarly focused on study and less on sports. All courses were my fun during high school, but my favourite
                course
                was Math.
            </p>
            <aside>
                <p> Ashok Patel was my Math teacher. Whenever I got a complex Math problem, he used some tricks to covert
                    it into simple one. I used to call that class, a fun class. In India, final exam of high
                    school, which is known as "Board Exam", plays an important role in college admission. I worked
                    so hard and secured 91% in my board exam and I got admission in my dream college. That was my best
                    memory of high school.
