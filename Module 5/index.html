          <h2>Bio</h2>
          <p>I am a student of Computer Science at <b>Stevens Institute of Technology</b>.
            I live in New Jersey with my family and I have travelled to many parts of the US.
          </p>
          <p>
            I love the weather of California, the Mexican food of Texas, the beaches of Florida, the grandeur of New
            York and the warm sense of home of New Jersey.
            When I am not working or travelling, there is a good chance you will find me watching Netflix.
          </p>

            My best friend always says - <i><q>The best way to know someone is knowing which movies they like and what
                their hobbies are.</q></i> And that
            brings me to the next section:
