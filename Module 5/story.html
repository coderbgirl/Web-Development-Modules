      <h2>A True Story</h2>
      <p>
        It was my junior year in college while pursuing my Bachelors in Electronics Engineering. I took a course
        called <q><b>Object Oriented Programming</b></q>, which was my first real exposure to high level programming.
        The
        course was a breeze for me as the lecturers taught really well and made it fun. This made me quite
        interested in the workings of modern programming frameworks and the Java language.
      </p>
      <p>
        I loved how programming felt like a puzzle and I enjoyed the problem solving aspect of it. The creativity it
        took to craft code was a really interesting experience for me. I wanted a deeper look at the theories behind
        the technology we use every day. I also wanted to keep getting my hands dirty with code and exploring how
        technology is made. Because of these reasons, I always thought if only I had majored in Computer Science.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are like me, who likes stories that have a happy ending, then this story is no different. After a long
        wait, I finally got the opportunity to pursue
        a graduate program in Computer Science at the top school of my choice - <b>Stevens</b>!
